### About Me

I’m a driven and pragmatic developer focused on building scalable, efficient systems. With experience across both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in delivering solutions that are intuitive, reliable, and maintainable.

I’m always exploring new technologies and approaches, whether it's optimizing backend performance, improving user experiences, or experimenting with IoT and automation. My passion lies in solving problems with thoughtful, innovative solutions that make a real impact.
